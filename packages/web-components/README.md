# Page blocks - web components

> [!WARNING]  
> This implementation, specifically the way it communicates with context + the editor will change in the future.

This package implements the `pb-slot`, `pb-context` and `pb-block` web components. It renders a UI for editing page blocks.

It's bundled with other Editor implementations and does not need to be used directly. (e.g. `@page-blocks/react-editor`)
